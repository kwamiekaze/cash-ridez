### 🗄️ **Database Schema**

All tables created with proper RLS policies:

- **user_roles** - Role assignments (admin/driver/rider)
- **ride_requests** - All ride data with status tracking
- **counter_offers** - Price negotiation system (structure ready)
- **ride_messages** - Real-time chat (structure ready, realtime enabled)
- **support_tickets** - Support system (structure ready)
- **audit_logs** - Admin action tracking (structure ready)

### 📦 **Storage Buckets**

Three secure storage buckets configured:

1. **id-verifications** - User ID photos (5MB limit)
2. **ride-notes** - Ride request attachments (5MB limit)
3. **chat-attachments** - Message images (5MB limit)

All with proper RLS policies and type validation.

### 🎨 **Design System**

- Modern gradient-based color scheme (blue-purple primary)
- Dark mode support
- Status badges with semantic colors
- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Accessible UI components

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Lovable Cloud (Supabase)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage with secure file policies
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth with email/password + OAuth
- **State**: React Query + React Context
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Validation**: Zod-ready structure
- **Date**: date-fns

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account at `/auth`
2. **Onboard**: Choose your role(s) and upload ID
3. **Get Verified**: Admin will review and approve your ID
4. **Start Using**:
   - **Riders**: Create ride requests
   - **Drivers**: Browse and accept rides
   - **Admins**: Manage verifications and monitor platform

## 🔒 **Security Features**

### Implemented
✅ Row Level Security on all tables
✅ Secure file upload policies
✅ Authentication required for all protected routes
✅ Role-based access control with security definer functions
✅ Input validation on forms
✅ File type and size validation
✅ Session management with proper token handling

### Best Practices
- Verified users only can request/accept rides
- One active ride per driver (enforced at DB level)
- Admin-only verification and user management
- Separate role table to prevent privilege escalation
- Audit log structure for compliance

## 📍 **Geocoding & Maps**

Currently using **mock geocoding**. To enable real geocoding:

### Option 1: Google Maps Platform
1. Get API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable Geocoding API and Maps JavaScript API
3. Add to environment (or Lovable Cloud secrets if using edge function)
4. Implement in `CreateRideRequest.tsx`

### Option 2: Mapbox
1. Get token from [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com/)
2. Enable geocoding API
3. Implement geocoding service

## 🎯 **Usage Flows**

### Rider Flow
1. Sign up → Upload ID → Wait for verification
2. Create ride request with pickup/dropoff details
3. Wait for driver to accept
4. Chat with driver (ready to implement)
5. Complete ride and rate driver (ready to implement)

### Driver Flow

## 🔐 **Environment Configuration**

All environment variables are auto-configured by Lovable Cloud:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`

No manual `.env` configuration needed!

## 🚦 **Feature Flags (Ready to Implement)**

Structure ready for:
- `FREE_MODE` - Free vs paid tier
- `ENABLE_STRIPE` - Payment processing
- `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_REQUESTS` - Testing mode

## 📊 **Database Indexes**

Optimized with indexes on:
- ride_requests(status)
- ride_requests(rider_id)
- ride_requests(assigned_driver_id)
- ride_requests(pickup_zip)
- ride_requests(created_at)
- profiles(is_verified)
- ride_messages(ride_request_id, created_at)

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

1. Create test users for each role
2. Upload sample IDs for verification testing
3. Create ride requests as rider
4. Accept as driver from different account
5. Test admin approval workflow

## 🎨 **Design Tokens**

All colors use semantic HSL tokens:
- `--primary` - Main brand color (blue-purple gradient)
- `--verified` - Success green
- `--pending` - Warning orange
- `--destructive` - Error red
- Gradients: `--gradient-primary`, `--gradient-hero`
- Shadows: `--shadow-glow` for emphasis

## 📱 **Responsive Design**

Fully responsive with breakpoints:
- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

## 🤝 **Contributing**

This is a complete starter template. To extend:

1. Review the database schema
2. Check RLS policies for your new features
3. Add UI components in `/src/components`
4. Create pages in `/src/pages`
